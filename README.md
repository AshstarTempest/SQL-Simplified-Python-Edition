# School Management Project

This project provides a set of functions to create a school class 12 management system using various data storage methods like CSV, Binary, MySQL, and Text. It allows you to manage student records, marks, and subjects. You can add, remove, modify, and view data for students, marks, and subjects.

## Project Structure

The project creates a folder named `Project` to store the files for different data storage methods.

# Project Documentation Updates

In this update, I've removed the function descriptions from this main Markdown file, and I'm creating separate Markdown files for each Python file. Our primary focus is on CSV and MySQL interactions at the moment, so I'll create two separate Markdown files for these topics. Please make the following changes when creating new function descriptions:

1. **CSV**
   - Create a dedicated Markdown file named "csv.md" for all function descriptions related to CSV interactions.
   - Include function descriptions for CSV-related methods in the "csv.md" file.
   - Update this main Markdown file with a link or reference to the "csv.md" file when it's created.

****mdfile :  https://github.com/AshstarTempest/SQL-Simplified-Python-Edition/blob/main/csv.md****
2. **MySQL**
   - Create a dedicated Markdown file named "mysql.md" for all function descriptions related to MySQL interactions.
   - Include function descriptions for MySQL-related methods in the "mysql.md" file.
   - Update this main Markdown file with a link or reference to the "mysql.md" file when it's created.

### By following this approach, we can keep the documentation organized and maintain separate files for different parts of the project.###

## Usage

- Modify the `sys` variable to specify the name of your management system (e.g., 'school', 'hospital').
- Call the appropriate functions to create, manage, and export data for your system.
- You can create tables for secondary data storage methods and add records as needed.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have a MySQL server set up with the correct credentials.
- Replace `"your_username"` and `"your_password"` with your MySQL credentials.

This project provides a framework to start building a management system, and you can expand it to meet your specific requirements.
